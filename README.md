# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Task
For this assignment we created a timed coding quiz with multiple choice questions. The app runs in the web browswer and features updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code that I wrote. 


## User Story
As a coding bootcamp student I want to take a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can guage progress compared to others. 


##Getting Started

    - Underneath the hood of this quiz I used a HTML page, CSS, and Javascript to create the necessary formatting and functions for the site. 

    - The header of the page inclues the timer, and a link to the high score.

    - When the page is first loaded you will see the start page with a "Sart Quiz" link that will allow you to begin the quiz.

    - When the link is clicked the screen changes to the first question. 

        - when the wrong answer is chosen- it will switch to a red color

        - when the correct answer is chosen- it will switch to a green color

        - then switch to the next question

        - repeat until all questions (3) are answered. 

    - When all questions are answered the end of the quiz is displayed.

        - user will then be able to view their score, and input initials 

        - website then stores initials and scores for future references
